a plugin trying to overhaul how minecraft damage works.
im trying to do this by splitting damage into different types. each item can deal 1 or more types of damage and enemies can have resistance and weaknesses
some damage types have special effects.
for example if you deal slash damage to an enemy it will also drigger a bleed DOT damage effect
here are the current damage types

-SLASH
-PIERCE
-BLUDGEON
-HEAT
-ALMIGHTY
-BLEED(DOT)
-BURN(DOT)
-NORMAL(used if an item was not modifed to use any damage type)
